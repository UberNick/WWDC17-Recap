Session video and resources: https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2017/802/

## Apps Should Provide
  - Predictability and stability
  - Clear and helpful information
  - Streamlined and simple workflows
  - A delightful experience

# Design Principles
## Wayfinding
  - Helping people to navigate in complex environments quickly
### Good Wayfinding Answers
  - Answers; (your app should answer these questions)
    - Where am I ?
    - Where can I go ?
    - What will I find when I get there ?
    - What's nearby?
    - How do I get out ?
## Feedback
  - Should be clear and understandable
    - Status
      - Status of the action should be indicated well enough. Must be clear
    - Completion feedbacks in the app
      - E.g clear trash animation in the mail app, lock sound in the phone, confirmation sound in ApplePay
    - Warning
    - Errors
### Good Feedback Answers
  - What can I do ?
  - What just happened ?
  - What's happening ?
  - What will happen in the future ?
## Visibility
  - Improves usability
## Consistency
  - Inconsistency undermines usability
    - E.g: We don't have to learn how to drive every time we switch cars
    - We expect that brake pedal is on the left all the time
  - Prefer iOS environment specific icons. People are familiar with them
### Internal Consistency
  - Provides cohesion
  - Fonts, colors, flows, icons should match to each other
  
## Mental Model
## Proximity
## Grouping
## Mapping

## Affordance
## Progressive Disclosure
## 80/20 Rule

## Symmetry

# Challenges Applying Design Principles
  - They can conflict with each other
  - Too much of a good thing
