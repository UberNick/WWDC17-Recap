# WWDC17-Recap
Summaries for the sessions taking place at WWDC17 in markdown format.

Notes are not intended to give the full experience or not aiming to replace watching them. They are just side notes if you want to check during/after the session or to get a brief idea before diving into.

- Frequently updated since I am trying to attend most of them and take notes at the same time,
- If you are watching one of the sessions here, focus on the content. Leave the short notes to me, I got you covered there,
- ~~I will be adding links to each sessions once they make the videos publicly available.~~ Done

Any PR's are welcomed for the session I couldn't attend. :pray:

Enjoy !
