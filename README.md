# WWDC17-Recap
Summaries for the sessions from WWDC17 in markdown format.

Notes are not intended to give the full experience or not aiming to replace watching them. They are just side notes if you want to check during/after the session or to get a brief idea before diving into.

Any PR's are welcomed for the session I couldn't attend. :pray:

Enjoy !
